Why Go?
    History
        Designed in 2007
        Announced in 2009
        1st Go release in 2012

        C
        C++
        Python
        Java
        Ruby
        C#
        Go

    1. Cross Compilation
    2. Backward compatibility
    3. Simplicity
        ONLY 25 keywords
        a. No access modifiers
        b. No execeptions (only errors)
        c. No classes (only structs)
        d. No inhertance (only composition)
        e. No pointer arithmetic
        f. No reference type (all types are value types)
        g. No implicity type conversion

    4. Concurrency
        Ability to have more than one execution path in our application
        1000s of goroutines can be executed with 1 or 2 OS threads
        Concurrency features are built IN the language itself
            go, select, range, channel (data type), <- (channel operator)
            APIs
                sync package
    5. Performance of Go is on par 'C'


    Paradox Of Choice (Barry Schwartz)

System.Threading.Thread t = new System.Threading.Thread(() => {
    // code to run in new thread
});
t.Start();

go func(){

}()
